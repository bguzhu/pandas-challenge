    "After analyzing the PyCity School datasets, one conclusion drawn is schools that spend significantly more overall as well as for each student generally have lower passing rates for math and reading. Even though the money is possibly used for more learning resources and better student support, school performances tend to worsen for the student population as a whole. Another conclusion is that charter schools, regardless if the student population is large or not, have better student performances compared to district schools. Wilson High School is the only charter school with a large student population that still has a high percentage of students passing math and reading. Given the trends and patterns within the datasets and to summarize this analysis, enrolling students in charter schools, preferably where the future school budgets will hopefully result in an improved student learning experience, can most likely lead to great education and success later in life.\n"
